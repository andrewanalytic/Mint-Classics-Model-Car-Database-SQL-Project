# Mint-Classics-Model-Car-Database-SQL-Project
### Analyze Data in a Model Car Database with MySQL Workbench

## Project Overview:
The Mint Classics project involves analyzing data from a fictional classic car model company to provide insights and recommendations for inventory management and warehouse optimization. The analysis is structured around three main questions:

  1. Are inventory numbers aligned with sales figures for each product line?
  2. Are there stagnant products in the inventory that require attention?
  3. Can warehouse efficiency be improved by eliminating or reorganizing storage facilities?



## Objectives:
  1. Explore and understand the Mint Classics database structure and content.
  2. Analyze inventory and sales data to identify potential optimization opportunities.
  3. Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis findings.



## Analysis Methodology:
  _ Database Import and Exploration: Import the Mint Classics database into MySQL Workbench and explore the tables to understand the data schema.
  
  _ Basic Summary Statistics: Run SQL queries to gather key summary statistics, such as total products, product categories, highest and lowest inventory quantities, and warehouse inventory distribution.
  
  _ Answering Major Questions



## Analysis Findings and Recommendations:

#### **Question 1: Inventory-Sales Relationship**
**Findings:** Trains and Classic Cars product lines exhibit low sales percentages relative to stocked quantities. Further investigation into individual product performance within these lines is recommended.

**Recommendation:** Optimize inventory levels based on sales performance to ensure alignment with customer demand.

#### **Question 2: Stagnant Products**
**Findings:** Several products have high inventory-to-order ratios, indicating excessive stock levels. Liquidating excess inventory for these products could free up space and capital.

**Recommendation:** Refrain from restocking products with excessive remaining stock to optimize inventory space and reduce holding costs.

#### **Question 3: Warehouse Efficiency**
**Findings:** Warehouse D demonstrates high sales-to-inventory ratio and efficient capacity utilization. In contrast, Warehouse C operates at suboptimal capacity.

**Recommendation:** Consider consolidating inventory from Warehouse C to Warehouse B, capitalizing on underutilized space and reducing operational costs.



## Conclusion:
The analysis provides actionable insights for Mint Classics to optimize inventory management and warehouse efficiency. By aligning inventory levels with sales performance, addressing stagnant products, and reorganizing storage facilities, Mint Classics can enhance operational efficiency and reduce costs.
